 Minor Project - India NewsMap @ https://nsdv-frctrd.github.io/

 This project tackles a time-consuming challenge faced by Indian government exam aspirants like UPSC CSE and State PSC exams: sifting through news articles to extract state-specific information. Current news APIs often lack state-level focus, and traditional methods involve laborious manual searches across articles and physical resources.

Our solution addresses this challenge by creating a Python-based application that utilizes news APIs to provide state-specific summaries of key points from relevant news articles. Users can select their desired state(s) and receive this information, saving them valuable time and potentially improving their comprehension and retention of exam-related news.
